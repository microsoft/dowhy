We generated a sample of single student admission entries, based on the admission numbers from the [admission table](https://www.randomservices.org/random/data/Berkeley.html) that is gratefully provided by [RandomServices](http://www.randomservices.org/random/) under the [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/). \n",

The goal of the study is to investigate whether UC Berkeley had a gender bias in their admission process in 1973."

    "In a graphical causal model, causal graph is the key component that encodes the causal-relationships between variables. We can start by building a mental model of the causal graph between variables in our study. As some subjects are attendly mostly by males than females, it is plausible to assume that Gender influences Department. Some departments are more competitive for entry than the others. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Department influences Admission. What we would like to investigate is whether Gender influences Admission. To validate this from data, we add a directed edge from Gender to Admission in our mental model."
