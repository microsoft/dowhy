## How to contribute
If you would like to contribute a notebook, raise a Pull Request that adds a new notebook to this folder.
For help with raising a PR, refer to the [instructions for contributing code](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy/blob/main/docs/source/contributing/contributing-code.rst).

Make sure that your notebook conveys the following points:

* What is the problem that the notebook is trying to solve? Ideally, there should be a real-world application/motivation.
* What is the causal question corresponding to the above problem?
* What datasets are being used? How were they collected? A brief description of features in the dataset will be useful.
* Code to show how DoWhy is used to address the causal question.
* Validation of the causal estimate(s). This can be through a mix of refutations and domain knowledge.
* Preferred: A comparison of the results from DoWhy to alternative, non-causal methods.
