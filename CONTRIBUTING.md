There are multiple ways to contribute to DoWhy. 

You can help us make DoWhy better, 
* Adding a Jupyter notebook that describes the use of DoWhy for solving causal
problems

* Helping implement a new method for any of the four steps of causal analysis:
  model, identify, estimate, refute

* Integrating DoWhy's API with external implementations for any of the four steps, so that external libraries can be called seamlessly from the `identify_effect`, `estimate_effect` or `refute_estimate` methods.
 
* Helping extend the DoWhy API so that we can support new functionality like interpretability of the estimate, counterfactual prediction and more. 

* Helping update the documentation for DoWhy

If you would like to contribute, you can raise a pull request. If you have
